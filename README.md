# **BAMAZON**

*Bamazon is an app created to allow customers and managers to view items for sale, similar to Amazon.

*bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js both utilize Node.js and MySQL to complete their functions.

*bamazonCustomer.js allows for the selection of an item, quantity, and outputs sale price or insuffient quantity. It is the consumer side of Bamazon. Item quantity is changed in the database to reflect a decrease in quantity of each item.

*bamazonManager.js is designed to allow "Managers" to see all items, items that have insufficient quantity, the items/number of items they would like to add, and to add entirely new items to inventory. Changes are meant to be reflected in the database.
